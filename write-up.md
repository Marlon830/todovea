# Technical Test Write-Up

## Backend Development

For the technical test, I was tasked with creating the backend for a todo app using NestJS. Here is a summary of the steps I followed:

1. **Research and Setup**: I began by looking up the official NestJS documentation to familiarize myself with the framework. This helped me understand the best practices and how to structure the project.

2. **Project Initialization**: I set up the project using the NestJS CLI and started with some initial tests to ensure everything was configured correctly.

3. **Following a Tutorial**: To get a better grasp of NestJS, I followed a tutorial which provided a hands-on approach to building a basic application.

4. **Coding the Server**: With the foundational knowledge in place, I began coding the server. I implemented basic modules, including:
    - **Users Module**: For managing user data.
    - **Todos Module**: For managing todo items.

5. **User Authentication**: I then implemented authentication for users, ensuring secure access to the application. This involved setting up JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user sessions.

6. **Testing with Postman**: I used Postman to test the authentication endpoints. This helped me verify that the backend was functioning as expected.

7. **Todo Management**: After confirming that user authentication was working, I implemented the todo management features, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete todo items.

8. **Final Testing**: I conducted thorough testing of the todo functionalities to ensure everything was operational.

## Frontend Development

After completing the backend, I moved on to developing the frontend for the todo app. Here are the steps I followed:

1. **Choosing a Framework**: I discovered that Create React App was deprecated. The official documentation recommended using Next.js instead.

2. **Project Initialization**: I started a new project with Next.js, setting up the initial structure and configuration.

By following these steps, I successfully developed both the backend and frontend for the todo app, ensuring a fully functional and secure application.
